# ClausR Map Design - Non-Fungible Tokens
This repository contains the NFT icons representing some of my artwork under the Simple Ledger Protocol and Juungle marketplace. The copyrighted "original" image shows the colours, full extent, and maximum resolution of the underlying artwork. Please ensure that these parameters fit your intended display purpose, e.g. desktop wallpaper, Zoom background, or printed graphic. 

The copyright and all intellectual property rights in the artwork remains with the creator, myself. Purchasing the NFT gives you the exclusive license to display and resell the connected artwork. Each NFT exists only once, and therefore the connected artwork can be used legitimately only by the NFT owner. 

Please make sure to save copies of all purchased image files. I will retain the NFT icons on this site to support blockchain scans and future marketplace listings. However, I cannot guarantee the icon listing in perpetuity. See https://sites.google.com/view/clausr-maps/ for more information about my work.
