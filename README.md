# ClausR Map Design - Non-Fungible Tokens
This repository contains the NFT icons representing some of my artwork on the Juungle marketplace. The watermarked "original" image shows the colours, full extent, and correct width x height ratio of the underlying artwork at a reduced size. Please ensure that these parameters fit your intended display purpose, e.g. desktop wallpaper, Zoom background, or printed graphic.

If you purchased an NFT, please email the transaction ID to <claus dot rinner at gmail dot com> to receive the unmarked, high-resolution artwork via email or file-sharing. Minimum available size is 1920x1080 in TIFF, JPEG, or PNG format.

The copyright and all intellectual property rights in the artwork remains with the creator, myself. Purchasing the NFT gives you the exclusive license to display and resell the connected artwork. Each NFT exists only once, and therefore the connected artwork can be used legitimately only by the NFT owner. I will delete my copies once you confirm you have received and securely stored your copy. I will only retain the NFT icons shown on this site to support blockchain scans and future marketplace listings. (However, I cannot guarantee the icon listing in perpetuity - please save your own backup.)
